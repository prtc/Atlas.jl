# Collaboration Chronicles

Stories from the Atlas.jl modernization project - documenting the human-AI collaboration process as we work.

## About These Chronicles

This section captures the lived experience of legacy code archaeology: the moments of breakthrough, the frustrations of complexity, the insights that emerge when domain expertise meets computational analysis. We believe these stories have value beyond just this project - they reveal what it actually takes to preserve and modernize scientific software.

Stories will be added as the work develops, reflecting the real journey of understanding and translating decades of Fortran astronomy codes into modern Julia.

## Stories

- **Here Be Dragons** (Phase 2) - The moment Claude Code hit the complexity wall trying to map ATLAS12's intricate COMMON block dependencies, and what we learned about collaborative problem-solving when one of us gets stuck in the labyrinth.

*More stories coming as Phase 2B develops...*
