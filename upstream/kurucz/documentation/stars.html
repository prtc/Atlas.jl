Will include atlases and computed spectra


This is just my list of directories with star names.
Not all of these will end up on the web.
Others will be added.

     I have started copying the test spectrum calculations 
that are extant to the web directory.  These spectra require 
considerable improvement before they can be considered 
realistic.  They were calculated either at resolving power 
of 500000 or 2000000 in Doppler space so that a shift in 
point number is a Doppler shift.  The wavelengths were 
generated from the expression

      WL=WLFIRST*(1.D0+1.D0/RESOLUTION)**(IWL-1).

Some of the spectra have been instrumentally broadened with a 
gaussian to smaller resolving powers at the same wavelengths 
using program BROADEN. The broadened spectra were then resampled 
at the center of an odd number of points using program RESAMPLE.  
The new points are uniformly spaced in doppler space.

     The spectra are presented in wavelength (nm), Hlambda
(ergs/s/cm**2/ster/nm), and continuum Hlambda (ergs/s/cm**2/
ster/nm) triplets.  The model atmosphere and a sample .COM 
file are also given.  The programs are changing rapidly, as
are the line data, so the same spectrum computed today might 
be different, hopefully improved.  Also the model atmosphere
probably does not have the correct parameters for the star.
In the detailed study of each star it is necessary to compute
many models and many spectra, varying the parameters.
