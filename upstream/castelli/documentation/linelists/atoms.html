Several loggf values were modified to better fit high resolution observed
stellar spectra with synthetic spectra. The used stars with references
can be seen at <a href="stars.html"> STARS </a>

We used the STIS-HST ultraviolet spectra of HD 175640 and HR 6000 to estimate
the loggf changes for Mn II and Mn III. For several Cr II and Fe II lines the Kurucz log gf values were replaced
by the Raassen and Uylings data (RU).
