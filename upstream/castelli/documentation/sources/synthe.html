Starting from NOVEMBER 2016 ONLY SYNTHE FOR GFORTRAN IS UPDATED !!!!

Here there are 2 examples which show how to compute synthetic spectra.


The first example shows how to compute a synthetic spectrum 
to be compared with HIGH RESOLUTION spectra for identification
and abundance analyses. The spectrum is computed in the region 7000-7210 A 
for an ATLAS12 model with parameters Teff=4970 K, logg=4.6, vturb=1 km/s [M/H]=+0.4.
In this case no lines from predicted energy levels are considered.

The second example shows how to compute a synthetic spectrum 
to be compared with LOW RESOLUTION observations (ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS)
for parameters determination and color indices computations.
When degraded to the ODFs resolutions these spectra should reproduce
the fluxes computed with the ATLAS9 code.
The spectrum is computed in the region 2500-10500 A for an ATLAS9 model
with parameters Teff=5750 K, logg=4.0, vturb=2 km/s [M/H]=+0.5.
In this case also lines from predicted energy levels are considered.
